wit-node
========

Easy interface for interacting with the [Wit.ai](http://wit.ai) natural language parsing API.

This project will expand as the Wit.ai API expands, but as it stands there's a single endpoint. You can hit this
endpoint easily with `Wit.message([your message])`, which uses Wit.ai to convert that phrase or sentence into an object
with an intent and entities if any were specified.

You will need to create a Wit.ai account and begin training it.

## Installation

```shell
npm install wit-node@">=0.0.2"
```

You'll need to set an environment variable named `WIT_TOKEN` or specify your token with `Wit.token = [your token]`.

```shell
export WIT_TOKEN=[your token]
```

Alternatively, you can pass the token to `Wit.message`.


## Usage

Wit uses [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) for promises, so the interface is nice and clean and reliable.

```javascript
var promise = Wit.message('Hi')
promise.then(function(result) {
  result.intent // will be Hello with the default Wit instance.
  result.confidence // will be relatively low initially.
})
```
